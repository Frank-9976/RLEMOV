# RLEMOV
For those with a CASIO FX-9750GII or similar, I've created a way to play GIFs on your calculator.

Calculator Downloadable is downloadable to your calculator.  See:

Calculator Source Code is for looking at the code in Calculator Downloadable without using the above program. Not used.  
Online Converter is the source code for the glitch website used to convert images to RLEMOV. Documentation is there.  

PROGRAMS (For each one, specify how many frames it should expect.)  
RLEMOV Standard parser of RLEMOV listfile.  
RLEMOV-M Deletes listfile to save memory while parsing.  
PLAY Plays frames. You can specify how much delay you want as well, via for loop.  
STEP Steps over frames.  

Tested on the CASIO FX-9750GII.
